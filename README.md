# Squaddle
##### (working title...)

Squaddle is my idea for a semi-open, semi-private, non-profit social network platform. Your squad starts with you, and you invite people in. It works like Facebook Groups, where there's openness and connectivity within the group, but from outside the group is opaque. Squads can message each other, with multiple members signing off on each potential message.

More to come, as this project is very new.
